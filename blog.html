    <h1 class="blog_title">A Practical Introduction to Monads (WIP)</h1>
    <p><i>September 26, 2021</i></p>
</center>

<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 0.</strong> Introduction </h2>
<hr>

<p> Hi. My name is Markus. I am a functional programmer. Today we are going to
    learn about monads. üëè </p>

<p> The goal of this tutorial is threefold:
<ol>
    <li>Present a consistent and
        simple mental model for monads and where they should be used </li>
    <li>Motivate
        the steps in actually implementing a monad as a design pattern</li>
    <li>Summarize and collect existing monad tutorials that I find are most helpful
        to beginners</li>
</ol>

To this end, <strong>please</strong> notify me via github if you believe
something warrants extra explanation, or if you think I misappropriated your
idea. Learning about monads from the smattering of resources online was a long
journey for me, so I probably did. </p>

<p> Let's get started. Monads can be summarized with one quote

<blockquote>A monad is a <i class="quote_em">burrito</i><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BY2009">BY</a>]</sup> in the <i
        class="quote_em">category of endofunctors</i><sup>[<a class="citation"
            href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/128628">V</a>]</sup>
</blockquote>

Just kidding. </p>


<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 1.</strong> The Monad Design
    Pattern</h2>
<hr>

<p> What is a programming language to a functional programmer?
<blockquote>
    For functional programmers, a langauge is built from <i class="quote_em">three main components</i>:
    <ul>
        <li><i class="quote_em">Types</i>, which include function types</li>
        <li><i class="quote_em">Data</i>, to populate those types, and</li>
        <li>a <i class="quote_em">Composition Rule</i> to combine well-typed functions and data in some useful way.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    So <code class="language-haskell">23</code> is a piece of data with type <code class="language-haskell">Int</code>
    and we can compose it with the function <code class="language-haskell">show :: Int -> String</code> to get some
    resulting data <code class="language-haskell">"23" :: String</code>. This characterization
    of Haskell isn't just made up either, the three components above make Haskell well modelled by a
    <b>category</b><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BM2014">BM</a>](<a href="#foot_1" class="footnote">1</a>)</sup>.
    Category theorists
    will say Haskell is comprised of
    <i>objects</i>,
    <i>morphisms</i>, and <i>composition</i>. These are exactly the same things as above, and in a way completely
    describes the behavior of a Haskell program at least at compile time.
</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">1.1.</strong> Extending Haskell</h3>

<p> Under this framework, the monad design pattern has a straightforward intepretation
<blockquote>A monad is a model of a <i class="quote_em">new langauge</i> which <i class="quote_em">includes a copy
        of base Haskell</i> but whose composition rule may <i class="quote_em">may
        do extra work</i> on the side. </blockquote>
<p>
    Situations where you might want to extend Haskell to do a little bit extra come up fairly often. Here's a list
    of little languages you might have wanted to work in in the past:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Haskell, but we
        can keep track of <b>one mutable local variable</b> alongside our computation (<code
            class="language-haskell">State</code> monad)</li>
    <li>Haskell, but we track if an <b>error</b> has been thrown and <b>short circuit</b>
        if so (<code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad)</li>
    <li>Haskell, but with <b>multivalued functions</b> modelled by
        tracking lists of possible inputs and outputs instead of just a single value (<code
            class="language-haskell">List</code> monad) </li>
    <li>Haskell, but on the side of our computations we're <b>parsing some data source</b> (<code
            class="language-haskell">Parsec</code>
        monad)</li>
    <li>Haskell, but we build an <b>abstract syntax tree</b> on the side
        without recursion (<code class="language-haskell">Free</code> monads)</li>
    <li>Purescript, but our
        computations can <b>specify the structure of a webpage</b> (<code class="language-haskell">HalogenM</code>
        monad)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the kinds of problems monads solve: we want a copy of Haskell that
    also has some extra <b>effects</b>. Notice that the we're talking about are not necessarily the impure
    side effects you might think of like <code class="language-haskell">IO</code>. In fact, given the same input all
    the above monads will produce the same results which is the definition of being pure just like everything else
    in base Haskell. While monads are very effective tools
    for modelling inpurity, and we will discuss this later, thinking of monads as necessarily impure loses the
    bigger picture. In the following sections, all our monads will be <b>pure</b>.
</p>


<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 2.</strong> Implementation </h2>
<hr>

<p> Before we dive into implementing this new little language, let's clarify what <i>having a copy of base
        Haskell</i> means. In our new language
<ol>
    <li><b>Types</b> will be analagous copies of base Haskell types</li>
    <li><b>Data</b> in base Haskell will be able to be promoted into corresponding data in our language</li>
    <li>Our new composition rules <b>will not do anything unexpected</b> and will be <b>interoperable</b> with
        existing Haskell code</li>
</ol>
All of these statements have precise meanings, called <b>laws</b>, and I've put them together in an appendix (TODO:
LINK). If you're
going to implement your own pure monad, you need to prove to yourself that your code obeys the laws.
</p>

<p>
    We're going to write this new little language in three steps.
<ol>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Functor</code></b>: This will build the <b>types</b> in
        our
        language. </li>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Applicative</code></b>: This gives us <b>data</b> and a copy of
        <b>base function composition</b>
    </li>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Monad</code></b>: This last step finishes off the dynamics of
        how our <b>extra effects compose</b> together</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.1.</strong> Types: Functor </h3>

<p>Our langauge needs types. </p>

<p>The types will be wrapped up versions of base Haskell types, so let's kick out monad off let's use a higher
    kinded type <code class="language-haskell">m a</code>. This way, if <code class="language-haskell">Int</code>
    is a type in base Haskell (spoiler alert, it is üò≤) then <code class="language-haskell">M Int</code> will be
    an analagous type in our new language.
</p>

<p> We should also build a bridge between base Haskell and this new language, to specify how outside Haskell
    functions should be applied onto it. We do this by defining <code
        class="language-haskell">fmap :: (a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code>, and remember to glance over the laws
    (TODO: ¬ßX.1 Link) and make sure <code class="language-haskell">fmap</code> obeys them. The fact
    that types in our language are just lifted Haskell types, alongside a lawful <code
        class="language-haskell">fmap</code> bridge, ensures that our new langauge doesn't do anything so
    strange as to break interoperability with existing Haskell code. </p>

<p> We're going to build the <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad at the end of each section, which
    will eventually represent a langauge with short circuiting errors. Here's it's data definition and <code
        class="language-haskell">Functor</code> instance: </p>

<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe1.hs"> </pre>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.2.</strong> Data and Base Composition: Applicative </h3>

<p>Let's populate these freshly minted types with some data. </p>

<p>To bootstrap some data in this langauge, we can lift data from base Haskell by implementing a <code
        class="language-haskell">pure :: a -> m a</code> function which brings some data into it's
    associated type. Now if <code class="language-haskell">5 :: Int</code> in base Haskell, it means that
    <code class="language-haskell">pure 5</code> will have type <code class="language-haskell">m Int</code> in
    our new language (truly mind blowing<sup>(<a href="#foot_2" class="footnote">2</a>)</sup>, I know ü§Ø).
</p>

<p>And while you were reeling from that deep revelation, you might have missed the fact that <code
        class="language-haskell">pure</code> accidentally just gave our new language functions too:</p>

<blockquote>Haskell is <i class="quote_em">Cartesian Closed</i>, meaining <i class="quote_em">Haskell
        functions are also data</i>.</blockquote>

<p>So our <code class="language-haskell">pure</code> function is can also promote functions, such as <code
        class="language-haskell">pure (== 6) :: m (Int -> Bool)</code> and <code
        class="language-haskell">pure (+) :: m (Int -> Int -> Int)</code>. However, there's a problem:
    Promoted functions don't compose with promoted data yet. Try plugging <code
        class="language-haskell">pure 4 :: m Int</code> into a function <code
        class="language-haskell">pure show :: m (Int -> String)</code> without knowing how to "unwrap" it
    and get the data underneath.
    In general (like in <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> where data values could be <code
        class="language-haskell">Nothing</code>) you won't be able to do this!<sup>(<a href="#foot_3"
            class="footnote">3</a>)</sup>
</p>

<p>Let's make our promoted functions behave like functions by explicitly defining a composition rule for
    them: <code class="language-haskell">(<*>) :: m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code>. Together with <code
        class="language-haskell">pure</code>, this defines an <b>applicative functor</b> or <b>applicative
    </b>. An applicative functor is a little languge with a copy of base Haskell data and
    composition: any composition we can do in base Haskell we can now do in our little language. Seriously!
    It only takes three functions to steal the entire Haskell language üòà. Look over the laws
    (TODO: ¬ßX.2 link) and try to convince yourself of this. </p>

<p>
    Here's the applicative functor instance for <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>:
<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe2.hs"> </pre>
</p>


<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.3.</strong> Composing Effects: Monad</h3>

<p>There's one more thing we need to push our language to do. To turn our copy of Haskell into a genuine monad, we need
    a way to compose effects. </p>

<p>The effect composition problem is best illustrated by our <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> example. When
    we use <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> as an applicative functor with <code
        class="language-haskell">pure</code> and <code class="language-haskell"><*></code> all we're doing is wrapping
    up normal Haskell computations inside <code class="language-haskell">Just</code>. Let's try writing a new function
    which might force <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> to handle a short circuiting failiure.
<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/rational.hs"> </pre>

Let's also say we're given a value <code class="language-haskell">x0 :: Maybe Double</code>. How would we plug <code
    class="language-haskell">x0</code> into <code class="language-haskell">as_5</code>? We could force the input types
to match
by doing <code class="language-haskell">(pure asy_3) <*> x0</code>, but this doesn't work because the resulting type
will be <code class="language-haskell">Maybe (Maybe Double)</code>. Try it, the value will be <code
    class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> when <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Nothing</code>, <code
    class="language-haskell">Just Nothing</code> when <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Just 3.0</code> and <code
    class="language-haskell">Just (Just 1/(x0-3.0))</code> otherwise. It's less <i>short circuiting errors</i> and more
<i>errors that stack up forever</i>. Worse yet, try to wrangle the types for a function which composes the result with
<code class="language-haskell">asy_5</code>, or a function which computes <code class="language-haskell">asy_3</code>
plus <code class="language-haskell">asy_5</code>!
</p>


<p>This is the essence of a monad as motivated by creating a copy of Haskell which also might do extra computations on
    the side of composition; we need some function to combine effects. (TODO: Citation for that talk with rails). </p>

<p>Let's write it: it's called <code class="language-haskell">bind</code>, with the truly bitchin' symbol
    <code class="language-haskell">>>=</code>, and type <code class="language-haskell">m a -> (a -> m b) -> m c </code>.
</p>

<p>And it turns out that's it! Our new language is done! Here's the <code class="language-haskell">bind</code> instance
    for <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>

<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe3.hs"> </pre>

You can verify that indeed <code class="language-haskell">x0 >>= asy_3 :: Maybe Double</code> and <code short circuiting
    to <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> when <code class="language-haskell">x0</code> is
<code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> or <code class="language-haskell">Just 3.0</code>, and otherwise is
<code class="language-haskell">Just (1/(d-3.0))</code> where <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Just d</code>.
Experiment with the values of the expression <code class="language-haskell"> x1 >>= asy_3 >>= asy_5 >>= asy_5 </code>
and try to imagine matching
on three levels of <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> like before, or worse yet solving the equation for the
singular points algebraicially! We're applied category theorists here, we don't get paid to do actual math with actual
numbers!
</p>


<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.4.</strong> Conclusion</h3>

<p>A monad is a new langauge which includes a copy of base Haskell, but whose composition rule might do extra work on
    the side. We've created new types with a bridge to Haskell, a pathway to promote new data, a composition rule for
    promoted functions, and an operator to combine extra effects. That's a monad! Feel free to buy yourself a
    celebratory burrito üåØ.
</p>

<p>I'd recommend you close this window and try to redo the <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad again, then
    work build the <code class="language-haskell">State</code> monad (TODO: Citation) (be sure to check the references
    on this one, there's a trick I didn't catch myself). Play around with some other monads too. The remainder of this
    article will lay out the <b>monad laws</b>, and some amazing things you can make monads do for you. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading, go forth and compose! üôè</p>

<h2>What else can Monads do?</h2>

<h3>Impurity</h3>

<h3>Imperitave Style</h3>
<p>There are lots of cool monads out there, with many
    cool effects. In fact, the effects themselves are sometimes so cool we don't
    really care about the computed value anymore. The >> operator is a version of
    the bind operator which throws away the result of the computation, and
    essentially allows us to just do stuff to the effects. </p>

<p> Say I'm in the Writer monad (Haskell, but we keep a log of type String on
    the side of our computaitions), and I have functions logHello, logUsername,
    logLoginTime which all just spit out values into the log and return some unused
    junk value of unit type (). If I just want to do them in sequence, I can chain
    them like this

    logHello >> logUsername >> logLoginTime

    This looks a lot like C pseudocode

    logHello(); logUsername(); logLoginTime();

    and do notation allows us to write this composition, which looks a lot like a
    sequence of commands, in a differnt style: do ...

    Neat! The characterization of monads as programmable semicolons is good, but
    it's incomplete. While able to use >> as a semicolon is a natural way to program
    in a lot of contexts, we know that bind >>= is really the full story. Just
    another saying which inspired this post. </p>
