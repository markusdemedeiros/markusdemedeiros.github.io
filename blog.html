    <h1 class="blog_title">A Practical Introduction to Monads (WIP)</h1>
    <p><i>September 26, 2021</i></p>
</center>

<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 0.</strong> Introduction </h2>
<hr>

<p> Hi. My name is Markus. I love functional programming. Today we are going to
    learn about monads. üëè </p>

<p> The goal of this article is threefold:
<ol>
    <li>Present a consistent and
        simple mental model for monads and where they can be used </li>
    <li>Motivate
        the steps in actually implementing a monad as a design pattern</li>
    <li>Summarize, collect, and relate existing monad tutorials that I find are most helpful
        to beginners</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, we're presenting a model of a monad as a <b>design pattern</b>. I like the framework I present here
    for a couple reasons: I
    think it motivates the implementation of monads above the problematic dogma of just matching types, I think it
    provides a robust framework which applies broadly across other monad
    tutorials, and I also think it highlights the connections to category
    theory which can make for a really amazing display of how powerful categorical reasoning can be
    even to an outsider. </p>

To this end, <strong>please</strong> notify me via github if you believe
something warrants extra explanation, or if you think I misappropriated your
idea. Learning about monads from the smattering of resources online was a long
journey for me, so I probably did. </p>


<p> Let's get started. Monads can be summarized with one quote

<blockquote>A monad is a <i class="quote_em">burrito</i><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BY2009">BY</a>]</sup> in the <i
        class="quote_em">category of endofunctors</i><sup>[<a class="citation"
            href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/128628">V</a>]</sup> </blockquote>

Just kidding. </p>

<p><i>The main content of this article is contained in sections <a href="#sec_1">¬ß1</a>, <a href="#sec_2">¬ß2</a>, and
        appendix <a href="#app_1">¬ßA1</a>.</i></p>

<h2 id="sec_1"> <strong class="section_heading">Section 1.</strong> The Monad
    Design Pattern</h2>
<hr>

<p> What is a programming language to a functional programmer?
<blockquote> For
    functional programmers, a langauge is built from <i class="quote_em">three main
        components</i>: <ul>
        <li><i class="quote_em">Types</i>, which include function
            types</li>
        <li><i class="quote_em">Data</i>, to populate those types, and</li>
        <li>a <i class="quote_em">Composition Rule</i> to combine well-typed functions
            and data in some useful way.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p> So <code class="language-haskell">23</code> is a piece of data with type
    <code class="language-haskell">Int</code> <sup>(<a href="#foot_1" class="footnote">1</a>)</sup> and we can compose
    it with the
    function <code class="language-haskell">show :: Int -> String</code> to get some
    resulting data <code class="language-haskell">"23" :: String</code>. This
    characterization of Haskell isn't just made up either, the three components
    above make Haskell well modelled by a <b>category</b><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BM2014">BM</a>](<a
            href="#foot_2" class="footnote">2</a>)</sup>.
    Category theorists will say Haskell is comprised of <i>objects</i>,
    <i>morphisms</i>, and <i>composition</i>, which is just the same thing as our categoization in ten-cent words.
</p>
<p>The
    way the types and data compose togther describe the <b>compile time behavior</b> of a Haskell program, and if we
    want to write another language inside of Haskell with the same runtime semantics it's sufficient to just define the
    three pieces above!
</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">1.1.</strong> Extending Haskell</h3>

<p> Under this framework, the monad design pattern has a straightforward
    intepretation
<blockquote>A monad is a model of a <i class="quote_em">new
        langauge</i> which <i class="quote_em">includes a copy of base Haskell</i> but
    whose composition rule may <i class="quote_em">may do extra work</i> on the
    side. </blockquote>
<p> Situations where you might want to extend Haskell to do
    a little bit extra come up fairly often. Here's a list of little languages you
    might have wanted to work in in the past: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Haskell, but we can keep track of <b>one mutable local variable</b>
        alongside our computation (<code class="language-haskell">State</code>
        monad)</li>
    <li>Haskell, but we track if an <b>error</b> has been thrown and
        <b>short circuit</b> if so (<code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>
        monad)
    </li>
    <li>Haskell, but with <b>multivalued functions</b> modelled by
        tracking lists of possible inputs and outputs instead of just a single value
        (<code class="language-haskell">List</code> monad) </li>
    <li>Haskell, but on the
        side of our computations we're <b>parsing some data source</b> (<code class="language-haskell">Parsec</code>
        monad)</li>
    <li>Haskell, but we build an
        <b>abstract syntax tree</b> on the side without recursion (<code class="language-haskell">Free</code> monads)
    </li>
    <li>Purescript, but our
        computations can <b>specify the structure of a webpage</b> (<code class="language-haskell">HalogenM</code>
        monad)</li>
</ul>
<p> In general, you can reach for a monad when you want
    a copy of Haskell that also has some
    extra <b>effects</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that the we're talking about are not necessarily
    the impure side effects you might think of like <code class="language-haskell">IO</code>!

    All the monads listed above are <b>pure</b>, because if you give them the same input
    their output won't change. Not all monads are
    pure, and in fact monads are a phenomenal tool for modelling impurity, but thinking of monads as just some "impurity
    hack" misses the bigger picture!
</p>
<h2 id="sec_2"> <strong class="section_heading">Section 2.</strong>
    Implementation </h2>
<hr>

<p> Before we dive into implementing this new little language, let's clarify
    what <i>having a copy of base Haskell</i> means. In our new language
<ol>
    <li><b>Types</b> will be analagous copies of base Haskell types</li>
    <li><b>Data</b> in base Haskell will be able to be promoted into corresponding
        data in our language</li>
    <li>Our new composition rules <b>will not do anything
            unexpected</b> and will be <b>interoperable</b> with existing Haskell code</li>
</ol> All of these statements have precise meanings, called <b>laws</b>, and
I've put them together in appendix <a href="#app_1">¬ßA1</a>. If you're going to implement
your own pure monad you need to prove to yourself that your code obeys the
laws, so make sure not to skip them! </p>

<p> We're going to write this new little language in three steps.
<ol>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Functor</code></b>: This will
        build the <b>types</b> in our language. </li>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Applicative</code></b>: This gives us <b>data</b> and a
        copy of <b>base function composition</b> </li>
    <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Monad</code></b>: This last step finishes off the
        dynamics of how our <b>extra effects compose</b> together</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.1.</strong> Types: Functor </h3>

<p>Our langauge needs types. </p>

<p>To make our language interoperable with Haskell the types will be wrapped up versions of base Haskell types, so
    let's kick out monad off higher kinded type <code class="language-haskell">m
a</code>. This way, if <code class="language-haskell">Int</code> is a type in
    base Haskell (spoiler alert it is üò≤) then <code class="language-haskell">M
Int</code> will be an analagous type in our new language. </p>

<p> We should also build a bridge between base Haskell and this new language, to
    specify how outside Haskell functions can be applied onto it. We do this by
    defining <code class="language-haskell">fmap :: (a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code>,
    and remember to glance over the laws in <a href="#app_1">¬ßA1</a> and make sure <code
        class="language-haskell">fmap</code>
    obeys them. The fact that types in our
    language are just lifted Haskell types, alongside a lawful <code class="language-haskell">fmap</code> bridge,
    ensures that our new langauge
    doesn't do anything so strange as to break interoperability with existing
    Haskell code like say <i>"our new language has no strings"</i> or <i>"our new language treats all odd integers as if
        they were 3"</i>. </p>

<p> We're going to build the <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad
    at the end of each section, which will eventually represent a langauge which tracks
    if a short-circuiting error has occured by having value <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> instead of
    <code class="language-haskell">Just</code> a non-error valiue. Here's it's data definition and <code
        class="language-haskell">Functor</code>
    instance:
</p>

<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe1.hs"> </pre>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.2.</strong> Data and Base Composition:
    Applicative </h3>

<p>Let's populate these freshly minted types with some data. </p>

<p>To bootstrap some data in this langauge, we can lift data from base Haskell
    by implementing a <code class="language-haskell">pure :: a -> m a</code>
    function which lifts some data into it's associated type. With <code class="language-haskell">pure</code>, if <code
        class="language-haskell">5 :: Int</code> in
    base Haskell it means that <code class="language-haskell">pure 5</code> will be data of type <code
        class="language-haskell">m Int</code> in our new language. Our langauge can have other data too, like <code
        class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> in <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> which is not <code
        class="language-haskell">pure</code> of any base Haskell data, but at the very least we have a copy of Haskell
    data. Truly mind blowing, I
    know ü§Ø. <sup>(<a href="#foot_2" class="footnote">2</a>)</sup> </p>

<p>And while you were reeling from that deep revelation, you might have missed
    the fact that <code class="language-haskell">pure</code> accidentally just gave
    our new language functions too:</p>

<blockquote>Haskell is <i class="quote_em">Cartesian Closed</i>, meaining <i class="quote_em">Haskell functions are also
        data</i>.</blockquote>

<p>So our <code class="language-haskell">pure</code> function is can also
    promote functions, such as <code class="language-haskell">pure (== 6) :: m (Int
-> Bool)</code> and <code class="language-haskell">pure (+) :: m (Int -> Int ->
Int)</code>. However, there's a problem: promoted functions don't compose with
    promoted data yet. Try plugging <code class="language-haskell">pure 4 :: m
Int</code> into a function <code class="language-haskell">pure show :: m (Int ->
String)</code> without knowing how to "unwrap" it and get the data underneath.
    In general, like in <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> where data
    values could be <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code>, you won't be able
    to do this!<sup>(<a href="#foot_3" class="footnote">3</a>)</sup> </p>

<p>Let's make our promoted functions behave like functions by explicitly
    defining a composition rule for them: <code class="language-haskell">(<*>) :: m
(a -> b) -> m a -> m b</code>. Together with <code class="language-haskell">pure</code>, this defines an <b>applicative
        functor</b>
    or <b>applicative </b>. An applicative functor is a little languge with a copy
    of base Haskell data and composition: any composition we can do in base Haskell
    we can now do in our little language. Seriously! It only takes three functions
    to steal the entire Haskell language üòà. Look over the laws <a href="#app_1">¬ßA1</a>
    and try to convince yourself of this. </p>

<p> Here's the applicative functor instance for <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>, which describes how
    short-circuiting functions and short-circuiting data should interact:
<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe2.hs"> </pre>

We can <code class="language-haskell">pure</code> and <code class="language-haskell"><*></code> together any sequence of
functions, and the
resulting function will pass <code class="language-haskell">pure x</code>
through that chain or evaluate <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> to
<code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code>! Furthermore, we can replace a
function <code class="language-haskell">pure f</code> with <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> and the entire
chain will automatically
short circuit. Try it yourself! </p>


<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.3.</strong> Composing Effects:
    Monad</h3>

<p>There's one more thing we need to push our language to do. To turn our copy
    of Haskell into a genuine monad, we need a way to compose effects. </p>

<p>The effect composition problem is best illustrated by our <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> example. When
    we use <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> as an applicative functor with <code
        class="language-haskell">pure</code> and <code class="language-haskell"><*></code> all we're doing is wrapping
    up normal
    Haskell computations we know will succeed beforehand inside <code class="language-haskell">Just</code>. Without
    artifically plugging in a <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code>, there's no way to actually get into an
    error state yet! Let's try
    writing a new function which
    might force <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> to handle a short
    circuiting failiure.
<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/rational.hs">
</pre>

Let's also say we're given a value <code class="language-haskell">x0 :: Maybe
Double</code>. How would we plug <code class="language-haskell">x0</code> into
<code class="language-haskell">s_5</code>? We could force the input types to
match by doing <code class="language-haskell">(pure s_3) <*> x0</code>, but this
doesn't work because the resulting type will be <code class="language-haskell">Maybe (Maybe Double)</code>. Try it, the
value will be
<code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> when <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Nothing</code>, <code
    class="language-haskell">Just Nothing</code> when <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Just 3.0</code> and <code
    class="language-haskell">Just (Just 1/(d0-3.0))</code> otherwise where <code
    class="language-haskell">x0 = Just d0</code>. It's less <i>short circuiting
    errors</i> and more <i>errors that stack up forever</i>. Worse yet, try to
wrangle the types for a function which composes the result with <code class="language-haskell">s_5</code>, or a function
which computes <code class="language-haskell">s_3</code> plus <code class="language-haskell">s_5</code>! </p>


<p> Solving this problem is the (warning: üá´üá∑) <i>raison d'etre</i> of the monad design pattern. We've
    copied Haskell so that we have effects which can stack up on the side, and to round off the monad we're going to
    specify how these effects combine back down! This is the <b>extra work</b> (the <b>effects</b>) on the side of
    function composition! All we need to do left is make a function which tells our monad how the extra work should
    happen. <sup>[<a class="citation" href="#SW2019">SW</a>]</sup>.
</p>


<p>Let's write it: it's called <code class="language-haskell">bind</code>, with
    the truly bitchin' symbol <code class="language-haskell">>>=</code>, and type
    <code class="language-haskell">m a -> (a -> m b) -> m c </code>.
</p>

<p>And it turns out that's it! Our new language is done! Here's the <code class="language-haskell">bind</code> instance
    for <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>

<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe3.hs"> </pre>

You can verify that indeed <code class="language-haskell">x0 >>= s_3 :: Maybe
Double</code> with value short circuiting to <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> when <code
    class="language-haskell">x0</code> is <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code> or <code
    class="language-haskell">Just
3.0</code>, and otherwise is <code class="language-haskell">Just
(1/(d0-3.0))</code> where <code class="language-haskell">x0 = Just d0</code>.
Experiment with the values of the expression <code class="language-haskell"> x1
>>= s_3 >>= s_5 >>= s_5 </code> and try to imagine matching on three levels of
<code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> like before, or worse yet solving
the equation for the singular points algebraicially! We're applied category
theorists here, we don't get paid to do actual math with actual numbers! </p>


<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.4.</strong> Conclusion</h3>

<p>A monad is a new langauge which includes a copy of base Haskell, but whose
    composition rule might do extra work on the side. We've created new types with a
    bridge to Haskell, a pathway to promote new data, a composition rule for
    promoted functions, and an operator to combine extra effects. That's a monad!
    Go buy yourself a celebratory burrito üåØ! </p>

<p>I'd recommend you close this window and try to redo the <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad, then
    work build the <code class="language-haskell">State</code> monad <sup>[<a class="citation"
            href="#VS_2016">VS</a>]</sup> (be sure to check
    the references on this one, there's a trick I didn't catch myself). Play around
    with some other monads too. The remainder of this article will lay out the
    <b>monad laws</b>, and some amazing things you can make monads do for you.
</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, go forth and compose! üôè</p>




<h2 id="app_1"> <strong class="section_heading">Appendix 1.</strong> Laws </h2>
<hr> This appendix outlines the monad laws. It's a summary of several pages in the
Haskell Wiki, and I'll also try to explain the laws under the presented framework where applicable.

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A1.1.</strong> Functor</h3> A
<b>Functor</b> must
obey two laws <sup>[<a class="citation" href="#HW_f_2021">HW</a>]</sup>.

<ul>
    <li><b>Identity:</b> <code class="language-haskell">fmap id ==
id</code>. Doing nothing must not induce effects. </li>
    <li><b>Homomorphism:</b> <code class="language-haskell">fmap (f . g) = (fmap f) . (fmap g)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Read also <i>The Functor Design Pattern</i> <sup>[<a class="citation" href="#GG_2012">GG</a>]</sup> for an amazing
    explanation of how Functors relate to other monadic concepts.</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A1.2.</strong> Applicative</h3>
An <b>Applicative Functor</b> must obey four laws <sup>[<a class="citation" href="#HW_a_2021">HW</a>]</sup>
<ul>
    <li><b>Identity:</b><code class="language-haskell">(pure id) <*> v = v</code>. The lifted identity function doens't
        induce effects. </li>
    <li><b>Composition:</b><code class="language-haskell">pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)</code>. Lifted
        base composition is composition in our new langauge. </li>
    <li><b>Homomorphism:</b><code class="language-haskell">pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)</code>. </li>
    <li><b>Interchange:</b><code class="language-haskell">u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u</code>. </li>

</ul>

<p>As a consequence, <code class="language-haskell">fmap f x = pure f <*> x</code>.</p>



<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A1.3.</strong> Monad</h3>

<p>A <b>monad</b> must satisfy three laws <sup>[<a class="citation" href="H_CM">H</a>]</sup></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Left Identity</b>: <code class="language-haskell">return a >>= k = k a</code></li>
    <li><b>Right Identity</b>: <code class="language-haskell">m >>= return = m</code></li>
    <li><b>Associativity</b>: <code class="language-haskell">m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h) = (m >>= k) >>= h</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a monad on top of an applicative functor also requires that <code
        class="language-haskell">pure = return</code> and <code
        class="language-haskell">m1 <*> m2 = m1 >>= (x1 -> m2 >>= (x2 -> return (x1 x2)))</code>, from which you can
    deduce that <code class="language-haskell">fmap f xs </code> must be <code
        class="language-haskell">xs >>= return . f</code>. Note that, after writing <code
        class="language-haskell">(>>=)</code> and <code class="language-haskell">return</code>, the code for the functor
    and applicative instance is boilerplate! This shortcut is how monads are often written, though the "long way" of
    writing a functor, then an applicative, then <i>finally</i> the monad is a helpful framework for monad design (and
    also sometimes for performance reasons). </p>

<p>Furthermore, pay attention to the fact that <code class="language-haskell">(>>) = (*>)</code>. The fact that monad
    and applicative sequence operators must be the same is the basis for ApplicativeDo notation, as described below.
</p>


<h2 id="app_2"> <strong class="section_heading">Appendix 2.</strong>
    Typeclasses, Monad Syntax, <code class="language-haskell">do</code>
    notation</h2>
<hr>
<p> The chain of typeclasses you implement for monads give
    many oftentimes very convenient syntax. This section is a summary of several
    pages in the Haskell Wiki, which I will attempt to give applications to the presented framework where possible. </p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A2.1.</strong> Functor</h3>
<p>A <b>Functor</b> gives you access to several methods for free in the package <code
        class="language-haskell">Data.Functor</code></p>
<ul>
    <li><code class="language-haskell"><$></code>, a synonym for <code class="language-haskell">fmap</code>. It's
        flipped function <code class="language-haskell">flip fmap</code> is denoted <code
            class="language-haskell"><&></code>. </li>
    <li><code class="language-haskell"><$</code>, a synonym for <code class="language-haskell">fmap . const</code> which
        can be overridden for
        efficiency. (TODO: Make note of how this works as a promotion function). It's
        flipped function <code class="language-haskell">flip (<$) </code> is denoted
        <code class="language-haskell">$></code>.
    </li>
    <li><code class="language-haskell">void :: Functor f => f a -> f ()</code> is a shorthand
        to discard a functoral value. </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A2.2.</strong> Applicative</h3>
<p>Like Functors, the package <code class="language-haskell">Control.Applicative</code> provides many convenience
    functions.<sup>[<a class="citation" href="#HW_a_2021">HW</a>]</sup>
<ul>

    <li><code class="language-haskell">liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> m a -> m b -> m c </code> lifts a binary function into
        the applicative functor. This can be used to instantiate the typeclass, see the source code for the equivalence
        .<sup>[<a class="citation" href="#HW_a_2021">HW</a>]</sup>.</li>
    <li><code class="language-haskell">(*>) :: f a -> f b -> f b</code> sequence functions by discarding the result of
        the first value (but keep any extra work done on the side). It's flipped function <code
            class="language-haskell">flip (<*) </code> is denoted
        <code class="language-haskell">*></code>. The default implementation uses a familiar function in <b>Functor</b>:
        <code class="language-haskell">u *> v = (id <$ u) <*> v</code>
</ul>

<p>
    A common idiom in is to use the <code class="language-haskell">*></code> function to
    sequence functions for their effects and a lambda function to give names to only the intermediate values we care
    about. In fact this
    is so common, there is a language extension <code class="language-haskell">{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}</code> to
    make
    this sequential aplication obvious! <sup>[<a class="citation" href="#AM_2019">AM</a>]</sup>. I won't fully explain
    here
    (it works similarly to mondaic <code class="language-haskell">do</code> notation explained below) but I can give an
    example of when you want to write code in the style of sequenceing effects for our
    in our <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> functor
<pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/applicativedo.hs"></pre>
As I hope you can see that, even lacking the full effect composition of a monad, applivative functors are
powerful model in their own right!

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">A1.3.</strong> Monad</h3>

<h3>(draft) Imperitave Style</h3>
<p>There are lots of cool monads out there,
    with many cool effects. In fact, the effects themselves are sometimes so cool we
    don't really care about the computed value anymore. The >> operator is a version
    of the bind operator which throws away the result of the computation, and
    essentially allows us to just do stuff to the effects. </p>

<p> Say I'm in the Writer monad (Haskell, but we keep a log of type String on
    the side of our computaitions), and I have functions logHello, logUsername,
    logLoginTime which all just spit out values into the log and return some unused
    junk value of unit type (). If I just want to do them in sequence, I can chain
    them like this

    logHello >> logUsername >> logLoginTime

    This looks a lot like C pseudocode

    logHello(); logUsername(); logLoginTime();

    and do notation allows us to write this composition, which looks a lot like a
    sequence of commands, in a differnt style: do ...

    Neat! The characterization of monads as programmable semicolons is good, but
    it's incomplete. While able to use >> as a semicolon is a natural way to program
    in a lot of contexts, we know that bind >>= is really the full story. Just
    another saying which inspired this post. </p>








<h2 id="app_3"> <strong class="section_heading">Appendix 3.</strong> <code class="language-haskell">IO</code> and Other
    Monad Tricks </h2>
<hr> Monads
model many <b>very</b> useful situations. We will give some examples, which will
hopefully become clear once the general theory of Monads is understood.

<h3>Impurity</h3>

<p>Most of the monads we've written so far extend Haskell in some small way like adding a tiny state, or just a little
    bit of a log. There's no need for this though- let's throw care to the wind and write literally the biggest monad
    possible! </p>

<blockquote>(TODO: Get phrasing) The <code class="language-haskell">IO</code> monad is Haskell, but on
    the side we compute the state of the <i class="quote_em"> entire
        physical universe</i><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#TS">TS</a>]</sup>.</blockquote>

<p>This seems silly, but it's the size we need to extend Haskell to capture everything that can happen to a program. We
    need to model arbitrary delays, gamma rays flipping bits on hard disks, fleshy meat automata yanking out network
    cables at inoppurtune times. </p>

<p>Fortunately, we don't have to <i>actually</i> simulate life, the universe and everything to do this. The physical
    universe does this for free. However, it does mean that we can't encode initial conditions in any way that captures
    all of the things that can possible happen during runtime and because of this, we cheat a little bit and say our
    monad is <b>impure</b>. </p>
<p>If there was some way the cram the entire universe into a data structure, this would be no
    problem, and we'd be able to break values out of <code class="language-haskell">IO</code> using pattern matching or
    some <code class="language-haskell">run_x</code> function like with other monads. But because we can't do this, and
    also because it's not a lawful monad, we say <code class="language-haskell">IO</code> is a special <i>impure</i>
    monad. </p>


<p>If you really want to break out of the <code class="language-haskell">IO</code> monad, and you know what you're
    doing, Haskell lets you with the <code class="language-haskell">unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a</code> function from
    <code class="language-haskell">System.IO.Unsafe</code>. There's nothing morally wrong about using this, but whenever
    you break the type system you should write a proof about why nothing bad will happen. Types are a great way to write
    proofs automatically, but sometimes a human touch doesn't hurt.
</p>

<h2 id="app_4"> <strong class="section_heading">Appendix 4.</strong> Category
    Theory </h2>
<hr> Sometimes people will speak about monads in the strange
language of Category theory. This section attempts to connect some notions from
category theory to the mental model we built in section <a href="#sec_1">¬ß1</a>,
and assumes a familiarity of category theory as applied to Haskell.

    <li id="foot_1">We're going to use concrete types in a lot of places here, so <code
            class="language-haskell">5::Int</code> instead of <code class="language-haskell">5::(Num p) => p</code> for
        clarity. </li>
    <li id="foot_2"> There are some nuances here, Haskell
        itself isn't a category. However, many subsets of Haskell are. </li>
    <li id="foot_3"> Note that, while it seems obvious, this is very important. For the
        Maybe monad, the one with short circuiting errors, we define pure x = just x
        which represents a non-error value. However, it is perfectly type satisfactory
        and rule following to define pure x = Nothing, which would result in a different
        Maybe monad representing computations which immediately give up without every
        trying. The point is, people who tell you to <i>just follow the types, man</i>
        are oblivious to the fact that we are writing definitions, and you should always
        keep in mind the purpose of what the function your implementing will ultimately
        represent in your final monad and how it's semantics should work. Frankly, this
        (infuriating) trope is the reason I made this tutorial.</li>
