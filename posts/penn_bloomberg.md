On March 27 I was invited to give a talk to the programming languages group at Bloomberg. Coincidentally, I was also invited to give a talk at UPenn on March 28. On March 29 I could not speak. 

The talk is about _Expectation Credits_, the principle encompassing both Eris and Tachis. My slides are available here: [pdf](../pdf/ErisTachis.pdf)
