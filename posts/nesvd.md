On April 26 I gave a talk at the [New England Systems Verification Day](https://svd.csail.mit.edu/2024/) workshop, located at MIT. 

The talk is about Eris, for which we have recently put out a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14223).
My slides are available in [pdf](../pdf/Eris_Presentation_nonanimated.pdf), or [keynote](../pdf/Eris_presentation.key) (fancy animations!)
