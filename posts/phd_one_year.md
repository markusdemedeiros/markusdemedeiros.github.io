I've been a PhD student for a year now. 
On paper I'm about 20% of the way through my funding, clearly this means that I just have to do the same thing four more
times and clock out as a freshly minted doc.


And to think they told me grad school would be hard. 

Nevertheless, it seems like a good time to take a snapshot of what I feel has been working, and the things I felt 
would make next year even better. 


## I've been a PhD student for a year

*Last year I published two papers with my research group:* [Eris](eris.html), and [Tachis](tachis.html). 
These are both seven-coauthor papers which improve on a prior line of work-- as a first year student I felt that setting to be exactly what I needed. 
Both of those projects were ambitious enough that I could claim ownership over parts of the development, but not so ambitious that 
a new researcher couldn't make meaningful progress.

If I were comparing PhD programs again, joining such a tightly-knit, organized, and active research group would be top of my list. 
I really enjoy working with all of them. 


*Last year I applied for a grant* which was due in October.
Writing this grant application was misery, I didn't get it.

However, I think that writing this grant application so early on was a great use of my time. 
In order to argue for funding I had to seriously think about, and then argue for, the vision I (read: my advisor) had for my research. 

As PhD students we're supposed to build our own narrative out of our research, but as (unexceptional) first-year PhD students 
we don't know nearly enough to really strike out into our own interesting directions. 
Writing this grant set the tone between my advisor and I about what we are trying to accomplish in really concrete terms, and 
it's helped us see eye to eye about 




*Last year I presented our work* at the [NESVD](nesvd.html) workshop. 
It turns out that I love presenting when it's about something I know well. 
I'm looking forward to doing it more! 




*Last year I started working at AWS*. 
I work on [SampCert](https://github.com/leanprover/SampCert), a library for verified differential privacy properties in Lean. 
If you think that seems an awful lot like my PhD research, you're absolutely right.
Thanks to the fact that Joe was such a precocious undergrad, I got the chance to see how the sort of thing we work on can translate 
to programs with concrete impact. 


I think that, be it industry or not, it is super important that you choose an advisor who is connected to the people who care about
the results your research. 



*Last year I did a bunch of classes*, and I was mentally absent for basically all of them. 
I think I've done a great job at putting in the absolute minimum effort possible to meet my grade requirements. 
As much as I'd like this title to say I *finished* my classes, I decided to drop a machine learning course after 45 minutes because it seemed
like I wouldn't be able to just write Rocq all class. 
I'll continue to be mentally absent in my computer graphics course next year.




*Last year I read a lot of papers*, and books too. 
I started grad school without knowing the first thing about program logics, dependently typed programming, logical relations, or probability theory.
If you removed these topics from the original Clutch paper, you probably couldn't fold a paper airplane out of the remains.

Now, these papers don't scare me so much anymore! 
I really enjoy the process of translating pen-and-paper proofs into the computer (which is great, because that's all I do at AWS), and 
I've put some time into reading some classic papers in each of these areas.


## Now what?

What do I want to accomplish next year?

*Next year I want to* understand my application domains better.
I'm thinking of auditing the basic measure theory and probability courses at NYU-- while my understanding of probability is good enough to work
under the watchful eye of Big Checker, I'm still not confident in my abilities to reason about probabilistic systems informally. 
The same goes for cryptography, and distributed computing. 
To make meaningful contributions to these fields, I should understand the problems they care about, and


*Next year I want to* teach. 
It's looking like I might be able to be a section leader for one of the undergraduate PL courses. 
I missed teaching from my undergraduate days, and I'm looking forward to doing some more!


*Next year I want to* work on my research independence.
I love my coauthors, but smaller groups are more healthy for all of our careers.
I'm chewing on a few research ideas that still in the same vein, and will probably involve the same cast of scoundrels, but whose overall direction is more my own. 


Another concrete thing I want to do here is work on more weekend-scale projects. 
At AWS I heard quite a few perspectives about how formal methods can be useful in practice, and even just getting my hands dirty with 
small but real verification challenges will hopefully translate into 



*Next year I want to* write more!
I absolutely have no issues yapping, in the past year I've posted 4600 times on Mastodon alone (Joe: don't do the math about how much time I spend on that website).
Next year, I should make an effort to collate some of that into self-contained posts: documenting the process of figuring out a new topic can be useful to outsiders,
and I'm basically already doing that in my own unstructured and incoherent fashion. 
Three blogs that write the content I'm thinking of are [Phillip Zucker](https://www.philipzucker.com), [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) and [William Bowman](https://www.williamjbowman.com/blog/index.html), 
I see no reason why I couldn't be doing the same!
