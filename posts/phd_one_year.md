I've been a PhD student for a year now. 
On paper I'm about 20% of the way through my funding, clearly this means that I just have to do the same thing four more
times and clock out as a freshly minted doc.


And to think they told me grad school would be hard. 


Nevertheless, as the summer starts drawing to a close it seems like a good time to reflect on how things have gone so far. 


## I've been a PhD student for a year


**Last year I published two papers with my research group**: [Eris](eris.html), and [Tachis](tachis.html). 
In both of these projects, I was one of seven coauthors. 
Despire the fact that my research group is rather large (playing abbreviation games to fit the page count is one thing... 
playing abbreviation name to fit the header limit is another) I felt that we were very well-cooridnated on the 
projects we worked on last year. 


A lot of my experiences last year boil down to ending up in such a great research group.
The projects we worked on had were ambitious enough for me to take meaningful ownership over aspects of the development,
but not so substantial that anyone's work was out of reach. 
As a beginner it felt like the perfect way to get my feet wet, and it was very satisfying to gradually work on 
harder problems as time went on! 

(Of course it helps that eveyone in the group is friendly and fun.
I'd even go so far as to even say that we're [magnificent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven).)


**Last year I applied for a grant** which was due in October.
Writing this application was challenging, and even through I didn't end up getting it I felt it was a very worthwhile excercise. 
Specifically the application involved arguing about the plan for and impact of my research-- while really meant understanding 
what that meant to _Joe_[^1]. 

Among other reasons, I wanted to work with Joe because I got the impression that we have a similar perspective on what 
our reaserch is meant to accomplish. 
Writing this application so soon after starting did a good job at setting the tone for real.
Often, I find that having a model of Joe's take on the world makes it easier for me to understand him, as I both 
try to learn the context of our field and find my own place inside it. 


**Last year I presented our work** at the [NESVD](nesvd.html) workshop. 
Despite a long history of hating it, it turns out that I love presenting when it's something I really care about! 
I'm really looking forward to doing it more. 


**Last year I attended local meetups**. 
In total I attended four-- I like that I get so many chances to meet new people from the area (including semi-new computer-people, of course!)


**Last year I started working at AWS**.
I work on [SampCert](https://github.com/leanprover/SampCert), a library for verified differential privacy properties in Lean. 
A large part of my day-to-day is writing proofs about probabilistic programs in Lean-- it's a lot like my PhD research,
but I also get plenty of chances to hear from teams in totally different areas of verification too. 


It's been valuable to learning about the variety of meanings for *impact* in our field, and I feel lucky to have an advisor 
who is well-connected with the people we claim motivate our work. 


**Last year I was pysically present in several classes**, and I was mentally absent for basically all of them. 
I think I've done a masterful job at putting in the absolute minimum effort possible to meet my grade requirements. 
As much as I'd like this title to say I *finished* my classes, I decided to drop a machine learning course after 45 minutes 
because it seemed like I couldn't slack off and write Rocq all class. 



## Now what?

What do I want to accomplish next year?

**Next year I want to understand our application domains better**. 
When it comes time to pick examples, I have a good enough understanding to grind through a proof as long as it's vigilantly 
checked by the computer. 
However to get really good, I want to be able to think more informally about the types of problems we're verifying. 
This means trying to audit a honest-to-god probability course, and working through the cryptography section of my Zotero. 


**Next year I want to teach**.
I've missed teaching, and I have to do it eventually anyways. 
It's looking like I might be able to be a section leader for one of the undergraduate PL courses. 


**Next year I want to work on my research independence**.
I have been chewing on some ideas I think are interesting new directions for our project, and I'm super excited to 
get back to working on it full-time. 
Knock on wood obviously, but I think it will be pretty cool to build up the narrative the whole way through. 

More practically, I want to take on little, non-publishable projects (Joe please un-read that sentence).
At AWS, I saw several examples of how even just trying to get the technical part of verification working can lead to unexpected
design problems. 
It's hard to make time for small projects, but I think that trying to make them more of a priority could help me find 
more new cool stuff to work on! 

**Next year I want to write more!**
I absolutely have no issues yapping, even about technical stuff. 
Next year I should try to document what I'm figuring out on here, I find it really useful when other people do that and there's really no reason why I can't do that same.
