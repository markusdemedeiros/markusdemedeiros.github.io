    <p>Our paper <em>Error Credits: Resourceful Reasoning about Error
    Bounds for Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs</em> will appear at
    ICFP 2024.</p>
    <p>This paper was written in collaboration with Alejandro Aguirre,

    Joseph Tassarotti, and Lars Birkedal.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Probabilistic programs often trade accuracy for efficiency, and
    are thus only approximately correct. It is important to obtain
    precise error bounds for these approximations, but existing
    approaches rely on simplifications that make the error bounds
    excesively coarse, or only apply to first-order programs. In this
    paper we present Eris, a higher-order separation logic for
    probabilistic programs written in an expressive higher-order
    language. Our key novelty is the introduction of error credits, a
    separation logic resource that tracks the error bound of a program.
    By representing error bounds as a resource, we recover the benefits
    of separation logic, including compositionality, modularity, and
    dependency between errors and program terms, allowing for more
    precise specifications. Moreover, we enable novel reasoning
    principles such as expectation-preserving error composition,
    amortized error reasoning, and proving almost-sure termination by
    induction on the error. We illustrate the advantages of our approach
    by proving amortized error bounds on a range of examples, including
    collision probabilities in hash functions, which allows us to write
    more modular specifications for data structures that use them as
    clients. We also use our logic to prove correctness and almost-sure
    termination of rejection sampling algorithms. All of our results
    have been mechanized in the Coq proof assistant using the Iris
    separation logic framework and the Coquelicot real analysis
    library.</p>
