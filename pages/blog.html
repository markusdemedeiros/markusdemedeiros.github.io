<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 0.</strong> Introduction </h2>
<hr>

<p> Hi. My name is Markus. I am a functional programmer. Today we are going to
    learn about monads. üëè </p>

<p> The goal of this tutorial is threefold:
<ol>
    <li>Present a consistent and
        simple mental model for monads and where they should be used </li>
    <li>Motivate
        the steps in actually implementing a monad as a design pattern</li>
    <li>Summarize and collect existing monad tutorials that I find are most helpful
        to beginners</li>
</ol>

To this end, <strong>please</strong> notify me via github if you believe
something warrants extra explanation, or if you think I misappropriated your
idea. Learning about monads from the smattering of resources online was a long
journey for me, so I probably did. </p>

<p> Let's get started. Monads can be summarized with one quote

<blockquote>A monad is a <i class="quote_em">burrito</i><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BY2009">BY</a>]</sup> in the <i
        class="quote_em">category of endofunctors</i><sup>[<a class="citation"
            href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/128628">V</a>]</sup>
</blockquote>

Just kidding. </p>


<h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 1.</strong> The Monad Design
    Pattern</h2>
<hr>

<p> What is a programming language? For functional programmers, a langauge has three main components:
<ul>
    <li><b>Types</b>, which
        include function types</li>
    <li><b>Data</b>, to populate those types, and</li>
    <li>a <b>Composition Rule</b> to combine well-typed functions and data in some useful way.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This characterization isn't made up either, the three components above make Haskell well modelled by a
    <b>category</b><sup>[<a class="citation" href="#BM2014">BM</a>](<a href="#foot_1" class="footnote">1</a>)</sup>.
    Category theorists
    will say Haskell is comprised of
    <i>objects</i>,
    <i>morphisms</i>, and <i>composition</i>, which are exactly the same things, and is the reason the <i>monad</i> has
    such an esoteric name.
</p>

<h3><strong class="subsection_heading">1.1.</strong> Extending Haskell</h2>

    <p> Under this framework, the monad design pattern has a straightforward intepretation
    <blockquote>A monad is a model of a <i class="quote_em">new langauge</i> which <i class="quote_em">includes a copy
            of base Haskell</i> but whose composition rule may <i class="quote_em">may
            do extra work</i> on the side. </blockquote>
    <p>
        Situations where you might want to extend Haskell to do a little bit extra come up fairly often. Here's a list
        of little languages you might have wanted to work in in the past:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Haskell, but we
            can keep track of <b>one mutable local variable</b> alongside our computation (<code
                class="language-haskell">State</code> monad)</li>
        <li>Haskell, but we track if an <b>error</b> has been thrown and <b>short circuit</b>
            if so (<code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad)</li>
        <li>Haskell, but with <b>multivalued functions</b> modelled by
            tracking lists of possible inputs and outputs instead of just a single value (<code
                class="language-haskell">List</code> monad) </li>
        <li>Haskell, but on the side of our computations we're <b>parsing some data source</b> (<code
                class="language-haskell">Parsec</code>
            monad)</li>
        <li>Haskell, but we build an <b>abstract syntax tree</b> on the side
            without recursion (<code class="language-haskell">Free</code> monads)</li>
        <li>Purescript, but our
            computations can <b>specify the structure of a webpage</b> (<code class="language-haskell">HalogenM</code>
            monad)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These are the kinds of problems monads solve: we want a copy of Haskell that
        also has some extra <b>effects</b>. Notice that the we're talking about are not necessarily the impure
        side effects you might think of like <code class="language-haskell">IO</code>. In fact, given the same input all
        the above monads will produce the same results which is the definition of being pure just like everything else
        in base Haskell. While monads are very effective tools
        for modelling inpurity, and we will discuss this later, thinking of monads as necessarily impure loses the
        bigger picture. In the following sections, all our monads will be <b>pure</b>.
    </p>


    <h2> <strong class="section_heading">Section 2.</strong> Implementing a New Little Lang</h2>
    <hr>

    <p> Before we dive into implementing this new little language, let's clarify what <i>having a copy of base
            Haskell</i> means. In our new language
    <ol>
        <li><b>Types</b> will be analagous copies of base Haskell types</li>
        <li><b>Data</b> in base Haskell will be able to be promoted into corresponding data in our language</li>
        <li>Our new composition rules <b>will not do anything unexpected</b> and will be <b>interoperable</b> with
            existing Haskell code</li>
    </ol>
    All of these statements have precise meanings, called <b>laws</b>, and I've put them together in an appendix (TODO:
    LINK). If you're
    going to implement your own pure monad, you need to prove to yourself that your code obeys the laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're going to write this new little language in three steps.
    <ol>
        <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Functor</code></b>: This will build the <b>types</b> in
            our
            language. </li>
        <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Applicative</code></b>: This gives us <b>data</b>and a copy of
            <b>base function composition</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Implement <code class="language-haskell">Monad</code></b>: This last step finishes off the dynamics of
            how our <b>extra effects compose</b> together</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.1.</strong> Types: Functor </h2>

        <p>Our langauge needs types. </p>

        <p>The types will be wrapped up versions of base Haskell types, so let's kick out monad off let's use a higher
            kinded type <code class="language-haskell">M a</code>. This way, if <code
                class="language-haskell">Int</code>
            is a type in base Haskell (spoiler alert, it is üò≤) then <code class="language-haskell">M Int</code> will be
            an analagous type in our new language.
        </p>

        <p>We should also build a bridge between base Haskell and this new language, so we can apply base Haskell
            functions into our langauge. We do this with <code
                class="language-haskell">fmap :: (a -> b) -> M a -> M b</code>. </p>

        <p> Here's the <code class="language-haskell">Functor</code> instance for the <code
                class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad, which will eventually represent a langauge with short
            circuiting errors: </p>

        <pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe1.hs"> </pre>

        <h3><strong class="subsection_heading">2.1.</strong> Data and Base Composition: Applicative </h2>
            <p>Now that our language has a lovely copy of the Haskell type system, let's populate it with a lovely copy
                of
                Haskell data! Specifically, the next thing we want to implement some linking function <code
                    class="language-haskell">pure :: a -> M a</code> which can promote Haskell data into it's associated
                type. If <code class="language-haskell">5</code> has type <code class="language-haskell">Int</code> in
                base Haskell (again, sorry to blow your mind here but it totally does) then <code
                    class="language-haskell">pure 5</code> will have type <code class="language-haskell">M Int</code> in
                our new language <sup>(<a href="#foot_2" class="footnote">2</a>)</sup>.</p>

            <p>We've also done a little more here than what meets the eye. Remember that in Haskell functions are data,
                so our new langauge already has things in it that look like <code
                    class="language-haskell">pure (+) :: M (Int -> Int -> Int)</code> and <code
                    class="language-haskell">pure (== 6):: M(Int -> Bool)  </code>. However there's a problem: these
                promoted functions
                don't compose with promoted data yet, so they don't really act like functions any more at all! Try to
                plug a <code class="language-haskell">Just 5</code> into <code class="language-haskell">Just (+3)</code>
                without unwrapping it (or even worse, plugging it into <code class="language-haskell">Nothing</code>)!
            </p>

            <p>We fix this by defnining a new function to handle this composition <code
                    class="language-haskell">(<*>) :: M (a -> b) -> M a -> M b</code>, and together with <code
                    class="language-haskell">pure</code> these define an <b>applicative</b> or <b>applicative
                    functor</b>. An applicative functor has a copy of base Haskell data and composition: any composition
                we can do in base Haskell we can now do in our little language. Seriously! Look over the laws (TODO:
                link) to convince yourself of what exactly what they have to do</p>

            <p>
                Here's the applicative functor instance for <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>:
            <pre data-src="blog_posts/monads_source/maybe2.hs"> </pre>
            </p>


            <h3>3. Composing effects</h3>

            <p>If you've been following along at home, you'll know that right now the extra
                stuff we're adding to our new little language is pretty boring. For example, if
                you're implemting the Maybe monad you'll have pure = just and <*> = ... This is
                    truly phenomenal boilerplate, which I'm sure will delight the ex-java readers,
                    but you should note that as it stands there is no way for a computation to
                    actually fail and short circuit yet! </p>

            <p>Suppose we are in the middle of a computation in our new little Maybe
                langauge and we have a x = Just 5 :: Maybe Int. Suppose also we have the
                function checkFive :: Int -> Maybe Int which is id except for 5 which is
                Nothing. Can we apply checkFive to our result so far to make it fail?</p>

            <p>If we use the tools we have, we could try x <*> (pure checkFive), but if you
                    run this you'll get a result of type Maybe (Maybe Int) with value Just
                    (Nothing). It sort of ran, but we're trying to model short circuiting here and
                    right now it isn't doing that. In essence, we need a way to combine these extra
                    effects together, and this is exactly what the bind function >>= m a -> (a -> m
                    b) -> m b does! Running again with x >>= checkFive we get the expected short
                    circuiting behavior with a value of Nothing :: Maybe Int. </p>

            <p>Monads are a way to combine effects. Congrats, our little language is
                complete! This concludes the monad tutorial! Buy yourself a celebratory burrito üåØ!
                (Note: If you're all excited and ready to implement your own monad, you must
                read Appendix A first. It's critically important for the details of this
                process) </p>

            <h2>What else can Monads do?</h2>

            <h3>Impurity</h3>

            <h3>Imperitave Style</h3>
            <p>There are lots of cool monads out there, with many
                cool effects. In fact, the effects themselves are sometimes so cool we don't
                really care about the computed value anymore. The >> operator is a version of
                the bind operator which throws away the result of the computation, and
                essentially allows us to just do stuff to the effects. </p>

            <p> Say I'm in the Writer monad (Haskell, but we keep a log of type String on
                the side of our computaitions), and I have functions logHello, logUsername,
                logLoginTime which all just spit out values into the log and return some unused
                junk value of unit type (). If I just want to do them in sequence, I can chain
                them like this

                logHello >> logUsername >> logLoginTime

                This looks a lot like C pseudocode

                logHello(); logUsername(); logLoginTime();

                and do notation allows us to write this composition, which looks a lot like a
                sequence of commands, in a differnt style: do ...

                Neat! The characterization of monads as programmable semicolons is good, but
                it's incomplete. While able to use >> as a semicolon is a natural way to program
                in a lot of contexts, we know that bind >>= is really the full story. Just
                another saying which inspired this post. </p>

            <h2>Footnotes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li id="foot_1"> There are some nuances here, Haskell itself isn't a category. However, many subsets of
                    Haskell
                    are.
                </li>
                <li id="foot_2"> Note that, while it seems obvious, this is very important. For the Maybe
                    monad, the one with short circuiting errors, we define pure x = just x which
                    represents a non-error value. However, it is perfectly type satisfactory and
                    rule following to define pure x = Nothing, which would result in a different
                    Maybe monad representing computations which immediately give up without every
                    trying. The point is, people who tell you to <i>just follow the types, man</i>
                    are oblivious to the fact that we are writing definitions, and you should always
                    keep in mind the purpose of what the function your implementing will ultimately
                    represent in your final monad and how it's semantics should work. Frankly, this
                    (infuriating) trope is the reason I made this tutorial.</li>
