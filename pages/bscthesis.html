    <p>This is an upload of my BSc. thesis, co-supervised by Alexander
    Summers and Aurel B&#xED;l&#xFD; (ETH Zurich). I presented an overview this
    work to the Prusti team in the summer of 2023; the slides are
    available below as well.</p>

    <em>Coupled Borrows: Expanding Core Proof Inference in
    Prusti</em></p>
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Prusti is a Rust verification tool which automatically infers a
    proof of memory safety from the Rust compiler internals. Prusti&#x2019;s
    core inference was originally described in terms of a data structure
    called the Place Capability Summary (or PCS) which describes the
    capabilities the Rust program has to memory at each program point.
    The PCS is not implemented in the current version of Prusti; this
    thesis explores a method for inferring the PCS as a separate step
    from the rest of Prusti. In doing so, we define a new data structure
    we call the Coupling Graph, which establishes approximate aliasing
    relationships between places in a form that is straightforward to
    derive from the compiler. Our approach enables a PCS to be derived
    for programs involving reborrowing inside complex dataflow such as
    loops, which the release version of Prusti does not currently
    support.</p>
