    <p>I&#x2019;ve been a PhD student for a year now. On paper, I&#x2019;m about 20%
    of the way through my funding&#x2013; clearly this means that I just have
    to do the same thing four more times, and clock out as a freshly
    minted doc, right?</p>
    <p>And to think they told me grad school would be hard.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, as the summer starts drawing to a close it seems
    like a good time to reflect on how things have gone so far, and how
    I can do better as I complete the rest of my PhD cakewalk. It&#x2019;s also
    a little bit of a retrospective on my choice to study with Joe
    Tassarotti at NYU, which I think was largely a very good one, even
    if at the time I had no idea why.</p>
    <h2 id="ive-been-a-phd-student-for-a-year">I&#x2019;ve been a PhD student
    for a year</h2>
    <p>What did I do with it?</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I published two papers with my research
    group</strong>: <a href="eris.html">Eris</a>, and <a
    href="tachis.html">Tachis</a>. In both of these projects, I was one
    of seven coauthors. Despite the fact that my research group is
    rather large (playing abbreviation games to fit the page count is
    one thing&#x2026; playing abbreviation games to fit the header limit is
    another) I felt that we were very well-coordinated on the projects
    we worked on last year.</p>
    <p>I feel very fortunate to have ended up in such a great research
    group&#x2013; the people, the project, and the timing lined up
    serendipitously for me as someone just starting out. The projects we
    worked on were ambitious enough for me to take meaningful ownership
    over aspects of the development, but not so far-reaching that
    anyone&#x2019;s work felt inaccessible. A lot of my time last year was
    spent just getting my feet wet by mechanizing increasingly difficult
    problems; it was satisfying that each step of the way provided some
    value to the group alongside progressing my own skills.</p>
    <p>(Of course it helps that everyone else in the group is friendly,
    smart, and fun. As a whole I&#x2019;d say we&#x2019;re pretty <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven">magnificent</a>.)</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I applied for a scholarship</strong> which was
    due in October. Writing this application was challenging, and even
    through I didn&#x2019;t end up getting it I felt that it was a worthwhile
    exercise. Specifically, the application involved arguing about the
    plan for and impact of my research&#x2013; which as a grad student toddler
    really meant understanding what research meant to <em>Joe</em><a
    href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
    <p>One of my primary reasons for choosing to do my PhD at NYU was
    that I felt that Joe had a good instinct for choosing important and
    interesting problems to work on. Spending time reflecting on Joe&#x2019;s
    vision, and arguing for it, set the tone between us in a very
    concrete way. Over the past year I can recall several times when
    knowing Joe&#x2019;s perspective helped keep me focused on the big picture,
    which is super valuable while I&#x2019;m still developing my own sense of
    research taste.</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I presented our work</strong> at the <a
    href="nesvd.html">NESVD</a> workshop. Despite a long history of
    hating presentations, it turns out that I love a crowd when it&#x2019;s
    something I really care about! The high point had to be pointing at
    a slide of Iris rules and calling it &#x201C;eye candy for the
    deranged&#x201D;.</p>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Fig 1. The aformentioned eye
    candy.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I&#x2019;m really looking forward to presenting more!</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I attended some local workshops</strong>. In
    total, I attended four. I like that I get so many chances to meet
    new people from the area (including semi-new computer-people, of
    course)!</p>
    <p>I remember Ron Garcia pointing out it was great that there are so
    many excellent schools are so close together in the northeast. As is
    typical for my interactions with Ron, he was totally right, but at
    the time I had no idea how right he was.</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I started working at AWS</strong>. I work on <a
    href="https://github.com/leanprover/SampCert">SampCert</a>, a
    library for verifying differential privacy properties in Lean. A
    large part of my day-to-day is writing proofs about probabilistic
    programs in Lean&#x2013; it&#x2019;s a lot like my PhD research, but I also get
    plenty of chances to hear from teams in totally different areas of
    verification too. It&#x2019;s been valuable to learn about the many
    meanings of <em>impact</em> in our field, several of which differ
    from the meaning of <em>impact</em> I see written about in papers.
    Blog post coming soon. Maybe.</p>
    <p>Of course, I&#x2019;m super thankful that Joe is in close contact with
    the industry. This is another point I think I undervalued when
    choosing where to do my PhD: I&#x2019;m not convinced that there&#x2019;s a better
    way to understand which parts of your research are useful, than
    seeing them get put to use firsthand.</p>
    <p><strong>Last year I was physically present in several
    classes</strong>, and I was mentally absent for basically all of
    them. Without patting myself on the back too hard (god, that sounds
    like a dreadful effort) I think I&#x2019;ve done a masterful job at putting
    in the absolute minimum effort possible to meet my grade
    requirements. As much as I&#x2019;d like this title to say I
    <em>finished</em> my classes, I decided to drop a machine learning
    course after 45 minutes because it seemed like I couldn&#x2019;t slack off
    and write Rocq all class<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
    <p>When I chose NYU I was excited to take abstract interpretation
    with Patrick Cousot, and I was also enticed by the fact that the
    math and computer science departments were so tightly coupled. This
    turned out to be both irrelevant and untrue: all of my classes were
    total snores, and I basically never have any reason to interact with
    the math department whatsoever. While I would have appreciated a
    separate math and CS department during my undergrad, coursework is
    so useless during my PhD that it just does not matter.</p>
    <h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2>
    <p><strong>Next year I want to understand our application domains
    better</strong>. When it comes time to pick examples, Joe can
    usually point my in the direction of one, and I can usually
    understand it enough to grind out a proof. However, my shallow
    understanding of probability, cryptography, distributed systems, and
    the thousand other topics that are tangential to our main line of
    work, doesn&#x2019;t help me come up with new and interesting directions we
    can explore.</p>
    <p>The arrow of time is steadily marching me forward to the point
    where choosing a dissertation topic becomes a major issue;
    proactively reading about related topics is one way I can help
    myself pick something compelling to work on when that time
    comes.</p>
    <p><strong>Next year I want to teach</strong>. I liked TAing during
    my undergrad, and I have to do it eventually anyways. It seems like
    I may be able to be a section leader for one of the undergraduate PL
    courses, and I&#x2019;m looking forward to that!</p>
    <p><strong>Next year I want to work on my research
    independence</strong>. I have been chewing on a new direction for
    our project for a few months, and I&#x2019;m super excited to get back to
    working on it full-time. I&#x2019;ve never really developed an idea from
    start to finish, and trying to take on more of a leading role in a
    group research project is a big step towards that.</p>
    <p>I also want to spend time working on little, non-publishable
    projects (Joe please un-read that sentence). At AWS, I saw several
    examples of how even just trying to get the technical part of
    verification working can lead to unexpected design problems. While
    it&#x2019;s hard to make time for small projects, I think that making
    &#x201C;getting my hands dirty&#x201D; a priority will pay dividends when I&#x2019;m
    looking for more cool paper ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>Next year I want to write more</strong>! I love to yap,
    and I especially love to yap about the technical stuff I&#x2019;m working
    on.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Next year I want to try to
    document the things I&#x2019;m figuring out, as it happens. I find a lot of
    value in reading about other people&#x2019;s views on a topic, and writing
    outside of a paper crunch could help my improve my technical
    explanation skills.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There is no conclusion to this. Ask me again in four to nine
    years if anything I wrote here is true.</p>
