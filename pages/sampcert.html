    <p>On June 18 presented our paper <a
    href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3729294">SampCert</a> at PLDI.
    The slides are, uncharacteristically, not available (they were
    stored on an AWS laptop and were presumably vaporized) but their
    memory lives on in my <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihu6zDwWvcM">video
    recording</a>.</p>
