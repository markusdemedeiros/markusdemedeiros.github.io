    <p>On March 27 I was invited to give a talk to the programming
    languages group at Bloomberg. Coincidentally, I was also invited to
    give a talk at UPenn on March 28. On March 29 I could not speak.</p>
    <p>The talk is about <em>Expectation Credits</em>, the principle
    encompassing both Eris and Tachis. My slides are available here: <a
    href="../pdf/ErisTachis.pdf">pdf</a></p>
