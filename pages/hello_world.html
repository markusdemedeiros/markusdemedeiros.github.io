  <p>This is the first blog post for my updated site. Maybe I’ll put my
  posts on the site proper one day, but for now a bunch of random
  markdown files will have to do!</p>
  <p>Oh also if I linked you to my old monads tutorial, just email me.
  I’ll rewrite it one day but it’s too long and confusing.</p>
