    <title>Surviving your Math Degree</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    UWU

  <p>I just graduated from UBC with a combined degree in math and
  computer science. I‚Äôm probably not the most qualified to talk about
  this, but here are some things which helped me survive that whole
  ordeal.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>cheat sheets</strong>. In my experience, pretty much
  all of the memorizable content from my math courses has been able to
  fit onto two or three pages (the flip-side of this is that the game
  <em>really</em> becomes learning how to build enough intuition to do
  proofs under time pressure). Making cheat sheets is a good way to make
  sure you haven‚Äôt missed anything, which totally killed my performance
  on more exams then I might like to admit.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>deconstruct proofs</strong>. Go through your list of
  theorems, and try to summarize each proof as succinctly as possible.
  Answer the question: ‚Äúif <em>I</em> were coming up with this proof,
  what would I have to notice to take the next step?‚Äù. A lot of the
  steps will probably be mechanical, so don‚Äôt waste your time thinking
  too hard about anything you can re-derive. I think that at this level,
  pulling out vague patterns (eg. ‚Äúif P depends on something being
  finite, it may work on compact spaces‚Äù) is a great substitute for any
  sort of divine mathematical intuition.</p>
  <p>Good exam questions normally only require a few really clever
  steps. At the very least, by extracting the common ones you can
  massively reduce your search space.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>contradict weakened theorems</strong>. Most of an
  undergraduate degree is a well-trodden path, and as such the theorems
  you will use are typically in their weakest possible form<a

  role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. You can exploit this for a study
  strategy: remove a precondition for the theorem and try to come up
  with a counterexample or a proof; it will usually be a counterexample.
  I mainly found that having a rich bank of counterexamples helped me
  intuit my way out of dead ends, which can be critical when you‚Äôre in a
  time crunch on a test.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>read several books at once</strong>. Your professors
  might seem like they‚Äôre pulling questions out of the air, but they
  definitely don‚Äôt. Always look for at least one other ‚Äúclassic‚Äù
  textbook on the subject (don‚Äôt ask me where I got mine üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è). If your
  professor is a domain expert they were probably influenced by some of
  these books, and this occasionally shows in the topics they test you
  on. In any case, hearing more takes on a topic is always a good thing
  for building understanding.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>take time off</strong>. Admittedly I‚Äôm privileged here.
  In the summer of 2020 I was out of work and living off of CERB checks
  from the government‚Äì for two months I had no responsibilities
  whatsoever. In that time I found a passion in logic and programming
  languages which completely changed the path of my degree. It‚Äôs
  impossible to try and tell someone to just figure our their life, but
  finding my focus let me start to do deeper reading in that area and
  gave me a useful motivating context for the classes I would take later
  on.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>trust the curve</strong>. This one mostly applies to my
  experience at a Canadian university. Unlike some other fields math
  exams have essentially no upper bound on how hard they can be, because
  the skill of ‚Äúcoming up with a proof‚Äù scales all the way up to ‚Äúdo
  novel research‚Äù and many subfields of math are able to state unsolved
  problems even after one undergraduate course. Don‚Äôt worry too much
  about absolute grades, if you‚Äôre in the right math courses there‚Äôs
  really no objective standard of knowledge an instructor can measure
  your ability against.</p></li>

  <li id="fn1"><p>One exception I found to this was in graph theory, but
  I think it‚Äôs because we were working on more modern stuff and also
  that number theory is satanic.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
