      <h2>Surviving your Math Degree</h2>

    <p>I just graduated from UBC with a combined degree in math and
    computer science. I&#x2019;m probably not the most qualified to talk about
    this, but here are some things which helped me survive that whole
    ordeal.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>cheat sheets</strong>. In my experience, pretty much
    all of the memorizable content from my math courses has been able to
    fit onto two or three pages (the flip-side of this is that the game
    <em>really</em> becomes learning how to build enough intuition to do
    proofs under time pressure). Making cheat sheets is a good way to
    make sure you haven&#x2019;t missed anything, which totally killed my
    performance on more exams then I might like to admit.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>deconstruct proofs</strong>. Go through your list of
    theorems, and try to summarize each proof as succinctly as possible.
    Answer the question: &#x201C;if <em>I</em> were coming up with this proof,
    what would I have to notice to take the next step?&#x201D;. A lot of the
    steps will probably be mechanical, so don&#x2019;t waste your time thinking
    too hard about anything you can re-derive. I think that at this
    level, pulling out vague patterns (eg. &#x201C;if P depends on something
    being finite, it may work on compact spaces&#x201D;) is a great substitute
    for any sort of divine mathematical intuition.</p>
    <p>Good exam questions normally only require a few really clever
    steps. At the very least, by extracting the common ones you can
    massively reduce your search space.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>contradict weakened theorems</strong>. Most of an
    undergraduate degree is a well-trodden path, and as such the
    theorems you will use are typically in their weakest possible form<a
    href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. You can exploit this for a
    study strategy: remove a precondition for the theorem and try to
    come up with a counterexample or a proof; it will usually be a
    counterexample. I mainly found that having a rich bank of
    counterexamples helped me intuit my way out of dead ends, which can
    be critical when you&#x2019;re in a time crunch on a test.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>read several books at once</strong>. Your professors
    might seem like they&#x2019;re pulling questions out of the air, but they
    definitely don&#x2019;t. Always look for at least one other &#x201C;classic&#x201D;
    textbook on the subject (don&#x2019;t ask me where I got mine &#x1F3F4;&#x200D;&#x2620;&#xFE0F;). If your
    professor is a domain expert they were probably influenced by some
    of these books, and this occasionally shows in the topics they test
    you on. In any case, hearing more takes on a topic is always a good
    thing for building understanding.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>take time off</strong>. Admittedly I&#x2019;m privileged
    here. In the summer of 2020 I was out of work and living off of CERB
    checks from the government&#x2013; for two months I had no responsibilities
    whatsoever. In that time I found a passion in logic and programming
    languages which completely changed the path of my degree. It&#x2019;s
    impossible to try and tell someone to just figure our their life,
    but finding my focus let me start to do deeper reading in that area
    and gave me a useful motivating context for the classes I would take
    later on.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>trust the curve</strong>. This one mostly applies to
    my experience at a Canadian university. Unlike some other fields
    math exams have essentially no upper bound on how hard they can be,
    because the skill of &#x201C;coming up with a proof&#x201D; scales all the way up
    to &#x201C;do novel research&#x201D; and many subfields of math are able to state
    unsolved problems even after one undergraduate course. Don&#x2019;t worry
    too much about absolute grades, if you&#x2019;re in the right math courses
    there&#x2019;s really no objective standard of knowledge an instructor can
    measure your ability against.</p></li>

    <li id="fn1"><p>One exception I found to this was in graph theory,
    but I think it&#x2019;s because we were working on more modern stuff and
    also that number theory is satanic.<a href="#fnref1"
